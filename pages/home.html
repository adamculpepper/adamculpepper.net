								<h3>Date formatting with jQuery UI</h3>
							</a>
							<p>If you’re developing for a legacy CMS or an absolute POS in-house built platform, you’ll most likely need to change the way dates are formatted on the page. Using jQuery UI this is possible and here’s how to do it!</p>

								<h3>Hide dead or broken images (using jQuery)</h3>
							</a>
							<p>If you're like me, and have tasted all or most of the Content Management Systems (CMS) the world (Internet) has to offer, you know how difficult it can be developing for legacy systems. A while back I was building a custom "Web App" for Business Catalyst that my client could easily update on the back-end to update a gallery of images. If you're familiar with Business Catalyst and it's "Web App" module, you know that if a data field is blank, it won't drop the data. The problem was that these images all needed to open in a lightbox once clicked. Looking back, I could have used jQuery's <pre>.wrap()</pre> or similar to wrap each image, but at the time I wasn't as smooth with jQuery as I am today. So at the time, with the limitations of the CMS (Business Catalyst) and the limitation of jQuery (HA!) I choose to hide/remove all images that didn't load. This had to be done to give the client enough spots on the back-end to upload images for each gallery set they wanted. At the time I used <pre>.hide()</pre>, but later changed it to <pre>.remove()</pre>.</p>

								<h3>Remove Title, First Name and Last Name on Web Forms in Business Catalyst (jQuery)</h3>
							</a>
							<p>If you're a Business Catalyst developer like myself, you often need to remove some of the default form input fields that are auto generated by Web Forms. Here's a non-destructive way to do that (using jQuery) for the Title, First Name and Last Name fields in Adobe Business Catalyst.</p>
